I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer Science in the University of Haifa, Israel. My research interests are mainly related to geometry processing, mixed reality, digital fabrication and robotics, focusing on interactive applications. I am also a member of the Computational Robotics Lab at the ETH Zurich. 

[//]: # (Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Interactive Geometry Lab at ETH Zurich, hosted by Prof. Olga Sorkine-Hornung, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Science, in the group of prof. Yaron Lipman. I earned my BSc in mathematics and physics, and my PhD in computer science from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, under supervision of Prof. Craig Gotsman.)
